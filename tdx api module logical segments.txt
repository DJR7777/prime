Current coverage in the starter Swagger
The existing specification already mixes authentication, directory lookups, ticket CRUD/feed/attachments/search, saved report execution, and attachment download endpoints in one document.

Suggested connector segmentation
To keep each Power Automate connector focused and manageable, align them with the major functional groupings from the official TDX Web API catalog:

Core Administration & Directory

Accounts, Applications, Attributes, Days Off, Feed, Groups, Industries, Integrations, Locations, People, Time, Type Categories, and bulk User Management endpoints let administrators manage foundational data and user records.

Keep Auth endpoints here (or in a tiny shared connector) so administrative automations can obtain tokens and work with directory metadata.

Service Management / Tickets

Ticket CRUD plus supporting catalogs—impacts, priorities, sources, statuses, tasks, types, urgencies, maintenance activities, blackout windows, and ticket saved searches—form a natural incident/service request connector.

Self-Service & Knowledge

Knowledge Base articles/categories, Service Catalog items, and Project Requests underpin request-intake experiences, so bundling them together keeps customer-facing automation separate from back-office processes.

Asset & Configuration Management

Assets, configuration items, relationship types, contracts, Intune assets, maintenance windows, vendors, product models/types, and asset/configuration saved searches suit a dedicated ITAM/CMDB connector.

Projects & Portfolio

Projects, tasks, plans, issues/risks, briefcase files/folders, project templates/types, and links cluster into a project-delivery connector aligned with portfolio management users.

Reporting & Analytics

Report Builder execution (and asset/ticket saved searches if you prefer to surface them outside their operational connectors) can live in a lightweight analytics connector, making it easier to enforce pagination/query patterns without cluttering transactional connectors.

Roles & Resource Management

Functional roles, resource pools, and security roles target staffing/governance scenarios; placing them in their own connector avoids exposing privileged endpoints in frontline automation.

Time & Scheduling (optional)

If you have heavy use of time entry and scheduling data, breaking Time APIs into their own connector keeps timesheet automation isolated from either service management or project operations.

Attachments & Feed (optional)

Attachments and feed entries are referenced across modules; either keep them with the primary module that consumes them (tickets/projects) or expose them via a shared “Collaboration Utilities” connector so multiple flows can reuse consistent file-handling logic.

This structure mirrors TeamDynamix’s own documentation hierarchy, keeps each connector aligned with a persona (service desk, knowledge manager, CMDB owner, PMO, reporting analyst, etc.), and minimizes the risk of hitting Power Automate’s action limits within a single connector.
